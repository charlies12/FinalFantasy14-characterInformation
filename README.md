# Final Fantasy 14 Character Info
This is just a small project that can use any existing or nonexisting character 
from the game since we can just input any values for now. I want to put all of my 
character's information that is based on the role and class with the highest level gear 
they can currently equip. Then just organize the data in a txt file.
